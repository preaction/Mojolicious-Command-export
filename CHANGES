Changelog for Mojolicious-Plugin-Export

{{ $NEXT }}

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed documentation using "paths" key instead of "pages". Using
      invalid configuration keys now throws a friendlier error message
      (instead of a "Can't locate object method" error...)

0.006     2019-07-18 20:51:05-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed 'mailto:' links being followed (and, most likely, a spurious
      404 error being thrown)

0.005     2019-07-06 18:41:58-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added Mojolicious::Plugin::Export to help with configuration and
      allow exporting from other commands/plugins.
    - Added `before_write` event to allow for viewing/modifying content
      before writing.

0.004     2018-11-11 10:24:41-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed "wide character in syswrite" by encoding HTML files to UTF-8.
      If someone would like to be able to configure the file encoding,
      that sounds like a good first patch for this project :)
      This also does not encode plain text files or other files that
      could be encoded (another good first patch for this project)

0.003     2018-11-08 21:39:27-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added resolving of redirects and replacing links. Now if one of
      your routes redirects to another route, all the links in your site
      will be fixed appropriately.

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed exporting pages with URL fragments in the path

0.002     2018-11-08 11:44:01-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added `export` configuration to Mojolicious app. Now you can
      configure the default export settings directly in your
      application.
    - Added `--base <url>` to rewrite absolute URLs. This helps when
      deploying a site to a folder in a larger site.

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed pages not being updated if they already exist in the export
      directory.
    - Fixed accidental export of error pages. Error pages aren't useful
      to export...

0.001     2018-11-07 17:24:19-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added ability to export a Mojolicious site to static files
