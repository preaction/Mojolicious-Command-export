    [Added]

    - Added `export` configuration to Mojolicious app. Now you can
      configure the default export settings directly in your
      application.
    - Added `--base <url>` to rewrite absolute URLs. This helps when
      deploying a site to a folder in a larger site.

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed pages not being updated if they already exist in the export
      directory.
    - Fixed accidental export of error pages. Error pages aren't useful
      to export...
